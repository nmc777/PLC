Panelview Plus Standard vs Performance
Performance is designed for large, complex, industrial systems, offering higher processing power, memory, screen options and enhanced connectivity.
Standard is for smaller, standalone systems with less processing power, limited memory, smaller screen size.
Both use differenct firmware and hardware.

Momentary Pushbutton
Only active during its duration of being pressed, until release.

Maintained Pushbutton
Changes position when pressed, and latches in that position.

Multistate Pushbutton
Same as maintained, but you have more than 2 states. When you click the button, it goes to the next state. Thus it increments by 1 each click.
